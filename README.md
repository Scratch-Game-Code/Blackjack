#Blackjack

This is your classic blackjack game, with standard blackjack rules.

You can play with up to three people Vs. a cpu-dealer.  The dealer plays by the standard 
casino dealer rules (if you know of anything thats not, please let me know).  

Each player can be on their own separate computer/device as long as it can run python and 
connect to your network.

Blackjack uses pygames, if you don't already have pygames installed, you can get a copy [here](http://www.pygame.org/news.html).

Put the images in your 'Pictures' directory.  Have someone run the server.py file, then everyone 
run client.py.
