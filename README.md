#Blackjack

This is your classic blackjack game.  With your standard blackjack rules.

You can play with up to three people Vs. a cpu dealer.  The cpu-dealer plays by the standard 
dealer rules (if you know of anything thats not, please let me know).  

Each player can be on their own separate computer/device as long as it can run python and 
connect to your network.

Blackjack uses pygames which you will need to install, you get a copy [here](http://www.pygame.org/news.html).

Put the images in your 'Pictures' directory.  Have someone run the server.py file, then everyone 
run client.py.
